## Name of Project: Paddy Boyle photography (old website)

This project was my first (paid) front end web development job. Photographer Paddy Boyle needed a website to display his 
property photography. He asked for a professional, corporate looking website. He was looking to expand his business and 
increase his online presence. This project was a learning curve for me. I basically taught myself to code using HTML5, CSS and 
Javascript. In hindsight I would have done a lot of things differently. For example: The fact that there are so many images and 
none of them were organised meant a lot of time was spent sorting them. I learned a lot from this job, I found that basic 
concepts like responsive design, mobile first design and external style sheets were easier to grasp when you are actually 
working on a project rather than reading or watching a video. It set my passion for web development in stone.
